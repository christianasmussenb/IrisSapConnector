This repo it's a ready to use docker project with a template to connect from InterSystems IRIS to an SAP server.

In order to connect with the SAP server, you must download the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK. Unfortunately, it is protected by copyright, and, for that reason, I can't share the files with you. So, if you want to download that software from the SAP page, you must have an "S" type user.

To connect it with the SAP server, you must add the required information to the file "sapnwrfc.cfg".
